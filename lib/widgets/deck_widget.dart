/// DeckWidget
/// ------------
/// This widget represents the draw pile (remaining cards) in the center of the game board.
/// Responsibilities:
/// - Visually display the back of a card stack (face-down)
/// - Show the number of remaining cards in the deck
/// - Optionally animate or highlight if a card is drawn
///
/// To be implemented:
/// - Tapping or triggering a draw should notify the game logic
/// - UI should react when the deck becomes empty
/// - Should reflect real-time card count from GameManager or GameState

/// FaceDownRow
/// -------------
/// This widget displays the player's 4 face-down cards placed on the table.
/// Responsibilities:
/// - Visually render 4 face-down cards (e.g., card backs)
/// - Maintain consistent spacing and alignment with the face-up row above
///
/// To be implemented:
/// - Cards should not be interactive until the player reaches this stage
/// - When playing from face-down, reveal card on tap and validate play
/// - Show feedback if an invalid card is played (requires pile pickup)
